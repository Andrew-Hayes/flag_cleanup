# Getting Started

## Purpose
This series of articles aims to get you up and running using the flag cleanup tool. This will go through a few stages from basic to more advanced usage. The steps we will follow are:

1. [Run a pre-configured example locally and observe the output](./1_running_locally.md)
2. [Understanding the flag cleanup rules](./2_understanding_rules.md)
3. [Running flag cleanup in a pipeline](./3_running_via_pipeline.md)
